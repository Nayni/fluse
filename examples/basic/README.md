## About these examples

The official examples from Fluse are written in the form of tests. You will find the domain model in `src/model` and the fixtures are defined in `src/fixtures.ts`. The tests show a few examples of how you can use Fluse to create basic and more advanced test data.

> **IMPORTANT**: The examples are part of the mono repo workspace. In order to run them successfully you'll have to clone the entire repository to ensure `node_modules` are hoisted correctly.
