The big strength of Fluse lies in its re-usability. Creating a single fixture is great, but Fluse is built to help with complex data sets.

Instead of creating one big monolithic fixture Fluse allows you to combine multiple smaller fixtures into a bigger one. Allowing you to compose together data sets by re-using smaller parts you've defined before. On top of that Fluse does this in a type-safe way.

```typescript
import { fixture } from "fluse";
import { User } from "./entities/User";

type UserFixtureArgs = {
  username: string;
};

export const userFixture = fixture({
  create(ctx, args: UserFixtureArgs) {
    const user = new User({ username: args.username });
    return user;
  },
});
```

Above is our first fixture. It creates a user with a given username. However in the system we are building users can make posts, thus we also have a post fixture:

```typescript
import { fixture } from "fluse";
import { Post } from "./entities/Post";

type PostFixtureArgs = {
  author: User;
};

export const postFixture = fixture({
  create(ctx, args: PostFixtureArgs, info) {
    const post = new Post({
      title: `post ${info.list.index}`,
      author: args.author,
    });
    return post;
  },
});
```

The above fixture creates a post for a given author, it also uses the extra info such as [list options](./making-lists.md) which will be useful for when we make many posts at the same time.

Right now we have 2 separate fixtures. We could naÃ¯vely execute those fixtures in sequence, but with Fluse you can do better!

We can combine the above and use the output from the `userFixture` as input for the `postFixture`, on top of that we can let Fluse create many posts by configuring the postFixture as a list:

```typescript
// src/seed.ts
import { combine } from "fluse";
import { userFixture } from "./fixtures/userFixture";
import { postFixture } from "./fixtures/postFixture";

const userWithPostsFixture = combine()
  .and(userFixture("bob", { args: { username: "Bob" } }))
  .and(({ bob }) =>
    postFixture("bobsPosts", { list: 10, args: { author: bob } })
  )
  .toFixture();
```

The above example shows how we've successfully combined both fixtures into a single fixture. We've also successfully passed the user that is being created from the first `userFixture` as the author of the second `postFixture`.

Let's go through this step by step:

- The `combine` function starts a [builder](./api-combine.md#combinedfixturebuilderand) that allows you to chain any number of fixtures together and combine them into a single result
- The `and` function allows you to pass any previously defined fixture as an argument, you consume that fixture just like any other fixture.
- Alternatively the `and` function also allows you to pass in a _factory function_. This factory function will receive any results from all previous fixtures in the chain (by name) and must return a consumed fixture. This way we are able to pass our user `foo` to the `postFixture` and make it the author of all the posts it creates.
- we end the chain my calling `toFixture()` which will produce a new fixture that is ready to be executed.

We can now use our new combined fixture to create all the data at once:

```typescript
import { createExecutor } from "fluse";
import { userFixture } from "./fixtures/userFixture";
import { postFixture } from "./fixtures/postFixture";

const execute = createExecutor();
const { bob, bobsPosts } = await execute(userWithPostsFixture);

bob; // User
bobsPosts; // Post[]
```

Notice how Fluse still provides you with a type-safe result which you can inspect and assert. The names you've chosen in the combined fixture are carried over into the result.
