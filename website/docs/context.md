Every fixture you create with Fluse has the ability to access a context object. This context object is used by [plugins]() to provide you utilities and/or database connections.

The context is Fluse's way of allowing you to plug into the lifecycle of a fixture and access any resources that might need to live outside of your fixture scope such as database connections.
